# CWC15-Terminal
================

A terminal based score-card client for Cricket World Cup 2015 matches. This is completely written in ruby. 
To execute this on your machine, just download the script and do,
  ruby CWC15.rb
in your terminal.
It will ask for match number, which can be found at sites like www.icc-cricket.com (A small work for you to do :p)

Features
--------
* If the match is completed it will show the match summary.
* If the match is yet to be played, it will give appropriate message.
* If the match is currently being played, it will show you the current scores. So at work, you can run this script in a tab of your terminal and continue your work. Check the tab for any live updates.

Limitation(s)
-------------
* Currently works only on windowed mode of terminal.(aligned with tabs and spaces)
* Irrelavant inputs are not handled properly anywhere, so I cant guarantee you 100% perfection.
